# WangTagReading
Conversion of old fashioned TIFFs with Wang annotation to modern TIFF or PDF with annotations with GdPicture.NET 14.

Wang annotation is an old and badly documented annotation format. In order to help several customers in trouble with thousands of documents using this deprecated format, ORPALIS has developed tools to convert these old-fashioned files to state of the art annotated PDFs or TIFFs.

This project includes the source code for these tools. Please note GdPicture.NET 14 is required to compile and run the software. The software can be downloaded from the web: https://www.gdpicture.com/download-gdpicture/

Please note because there are a number of Wang annotation flavors, this software is limited to the cases reported by customers. Feel free to contact ORPALIS in case you need to extend the capabilities of these tools: http://www.gdpicture.com/contact/
